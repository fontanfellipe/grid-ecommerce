### Introduction
This project was made with create-react-app and build in heroku (https://teste-js-linx.herokuapp.com/) 
### About the project


This project was a great project to apply some really important concepts of javascript and react. Using some important built in functions of JS and ES6, fetch data and work with them and some principles of react like props and states.
I divided the projects in some steps and pass these steps to github commits, they are:
### boilerplate -everything is setup. (yarn, dependecies, localserver, heroku, github).
### fetch data from the first url and populating the dom with the html backbone
I did that first because I need the data to start give some structure to the project, specially the products grid, which is probably the most important component.
### fetch data from the second url and append to the dom as well.
I did that as second step to have all data to start build the most important part of the application (the products grid).
### Style the products grid
My priority was that the procuct grid was made, so once I got the data to make the grid I start to make it
### finish the html and css of the static components
After the products grid was working fine I focus on finish all the html and css that had to be done to make the webpage work as the mock.
### css responsiveness - error handling - and small adjustments
After I had the MVP of the webpage I focus and make it responsive to small screens as well and do some adjustments in the code as some clean up, and some refactoring in some fetched data.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
